  # aff_a.c
    Write a program that takes a string, and displays the first 'a' character it
    encounters in it, followed by a newline. If there are no 'a' characters in the
    string, the program just writes a newline. If the number of parameters is not
    1, the program displays 'a' followed by a newline.

  # aff_first_param.c
    Write a program that takes strings as arguments, and displays its first
    argument followed by a \n.
    If the number of arguments is less than 1, the program displays \n.

  # aff_last_param.c
    Write a program that takes strings as arguments, and displays its last
    argument followed by a newline.    
    If the number of arguments is less than 1, the program displays a newline.

  # aff_z.c
    Write a program that takes a string, and displays the first 'a' character it
    encounters in it, followed by a newline. If there are no 'a' characters in the
    string, the program just writes a newline. If the number of parameters is not
    1, the program displays 'a' followed by a newline.

  # expand_str.c
    Write a program that takes a string and displays it with exactly three spaces
    between each word, with no spaces or tabs either at the beginning or the end,
    followed by a newline.    
    A word is a section of string delimited either by spaces/tabs, or by the
    start/end of the string.    
    If the number of parameters is not 1, or if there are no words, simply display
    a newline.

  # first_word.c
    Write a program that takes a string and displays its first word, followed by a
    newline.    
    A word is a section of string delimited by spaces/tabs or by the start/end of
    the string.    
    If the number of parameters is not 1, or if there are no words, simply display
    a newline.

  # fizzbuzz.c
    Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, each separated by a
    newline.    
    If the number is a multiple of 3, it prints 'fizz' instead.    
    If the number is a multiple of 5, it prints 'buzz' instead.    
    If the number is both a multiple of 3 and a multiple of 5, it prints 'fizzbuzz' instead.

  # ft_putstr.c
    Write a function that displays a string on the standard output.
    The pointer passed to the function contains the address of the string's first
    character.
    Your function must be declared as follows:
    void	ft_putstr(char *str);

  # ft_range.c
    Write the following function:
    int     *ft_range(int start, int end);
    It must allocate (with malloc()) an array of integers, fill it with consecutive
    values that begin at start and end at end (Including start and end !), then
    return a pointer to the first value of the array.

  # ft_rrange.c
    Write the following function:
    int     *ft_rrange(int start, int end);
    It must allocate (with malloc()) an array of integers, fill it with consecutive
    values that begin at end and end at start (Including start and end !), then
    return a pointer to the first value of the array.

  # ft_strlen.c
    Write a function that returns the length of a string.
    Your function must be declared as follows:
    int	ft_strlen(char *str);

  # inter.c
    Write a program that takes two strings and displays, without doubles, the
    characters that appear in both strings, in the order they appear in the first
    one.
    The display will be followed by a \n.
    If the number of arguments is not 2, the program displays \n.

  # ft_itoa.c
    Write a function that takes an int and converts it to a null-terminated string.
    The function returns the result in a char array that you must allocate.
    Your function must be declared as follows:
    char	*ft_itoa(int nbr);

  # rev_print.c
    Write a program that takes a string, and displays the string in reverse
    followed by a newline.    
    If the number of parameters is not 1, the program displays a newline.

  # rot_13.c
    Write a program that takes a string and displays it, replacing each of its
    letters by the letter 13 spaces ahead in alphabetical order.
    'z' becomes 'm' and 'Z' becomes 'M'. Case remains unaffected.
    The output will be followed by a newline.
    If the number of arguments is not 1, the program displays a newline.

  # rotone.c
    Write a program that takes a string and displays it, replacing each of its
    letters by the next one in alphabetical order. 'z' becomes 'a' and 'Z' becomes 'A'.
    Case remains unaffected. The output will be followed by a \n.
    If the number of arguments is not 1, the program displays \n.

  # ft_split.c
    Write a function that takes a string, splits it into words, and returns them as
    a NULL-terminated array of strings.    
    A "word" is defined as a part of a string delimited either by spaces/tabs/new
    lines, or by the start/end of the string.    
    Your function must be declared as follows:    
    char    **ft_split(char *str);

   # union.c
     Write a program that takes two strings and displays, without doubles, the
    characters that appear in either one of the strings.
    The display will be in the order characters appear in the command line, and
    will be followed by a \n.
    If the number of arguments is not 2, the program displays \n.
